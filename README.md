# Assignment 1: React Pizza

## Deliverables: 

### Assignment 1

From assignment 0 you should have attempted the design, mockup and prototyping of a user interface for a "Price Line" style pizza app.

Later on, I told you to model your work based on this: https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html

So, our journey here is quite simple: translate your HTML/Bootstrap work into ReactJS components.

Guidance for this may come from at least these three sources:

The Book: Chapters 1-3 in particular
The Documentation: Start here (https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) and go through section 12
My videos - I just posted two on this topic (look in Lessons/Videos)
What to Submit

Copy and paste the URL to your Github repo here
ZIP up the directory containing your work and submit it here (follow the example from my videos)

## To run locally: 

To run on your own machine clone this repository, then, in the root of this repo, run `npm install`. 

This will satisfy any missing dependencies, once node has installed for this app you can start dev server via `npm start`

This should automatically open your default browser to http://localhost:3000<br>
To stop the server, press Control-C in the console.<br>
Created following [this tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reactjs/reactjs_environment_setup.htm)<br>
There are two sets of instructions on this page, this version was built via create-react-app tool (second set of instructions listed on page) 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

This repo does not have any tests configured yet.
