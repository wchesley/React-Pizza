### Assignment 3

Assignment 3 - Pizza Bandit Signup and Ordering

You've followed along with me all semester so far with the Pizza Bandit program.  This assignment sees us completing that assignment for the ReactJS-only portion of the course.  You'll accomplish and complete the following:

* Create a basic ReactJS app
* Create a form that allows a user to sign up with an account
    email and password
    save this information to Firebase
* Create a form that allows a user to order a pizza
    user must be signed in
    use location services to get lat/lon
    use a web service to get ZIP code from lat lon
    select from three pizzas - cheese, pepperoni, and supreme
* Order sourcing and order saving
* Using ZIP code find nearby Pizza places - we'll use a real web service here
* Confirmation and delivery screen
    finalize delivery street address
    show delivery street address on mapbox
    You'll save the order to Firebase
    You'll confirm the order via an email

This is a significant undertaking and the remainder of our class time between then and now will focus on these requirements.

The first eight chapters of the Thomas book are instructive in getting this completed.

#### Submitting your Work

You'll deliver this app via the following means:

* Github repository URL
* Zipped up and uploaded here

## To run locally: 

To run on your own machine clone this repository, then, in the root of this repo, run <br>`npm install`<br>After the initial install, there are a few other further dependencies to satify, 

* react-router-dom: this can be installed by 
    `npm install --save react-router-dom` 
* firebase: this is installed by
    `npm install firebase`

This will satisfy any missing dependencies, once node has installed for this app you can start dev server via `npm start`

This should automatically open your default browser to http://localhost:3000<br>
To stop the server, press Control-C in the console.<br>
